        welcome to my webpage ..
              in this page i wanna talk about a journey of programimming. i know it's a long way to accsess your goals or
              your aim . everyone of us want to be succesful of his job or his career. but, programimming is a big field . 
              So you have to specialize in it. This is the best part of the topic, because programming includes a lot of fields.
              I would love to specialize in web programming. And you can specialize in programming games, programs or 
              operating systems or soft ware developer. But first of all, you have to know what programming is.

                    if you want to work in web . you must learn..
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5</li>
                        <li>CSS3</li>
                        <li>JAVA SCRIPT</li>
                    </ul>
                    and else, but it's not important to learn all this for beginning
                    it's enough to learn <b>html ,css &java script</b> and you should specialize 
                    if you want to be a web developer or desgnier.

                Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell the computer how
                to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is
